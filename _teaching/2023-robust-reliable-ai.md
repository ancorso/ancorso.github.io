The course occured over 5 days with 2-hour lectures and homework assignments. The topics covered each day were:
* Day 1: Robust Machine Learning
    * The big iid lie in ML
    * Definition and examples of distribution shifts
    * Mitigation strategies such as data augmentation, ensembling, fine-tuning

* Day 2: Model Explanation and Verification
    * Why go beyond accuracy for model evaluation?
    * Methods for explaining black-box models
    * Neural network verification

* Day 3: Uncertainty Quantification
    * Aleatoric vs. Epistemic uncertainty
    * Algorithms for quantifying aleatoric uncertainty
    * Algorithms for quantifying epistemic uncertainty

* Day 4: Closed-Loop Analysis
    * Safety properties of closed-loops systems
    * How to model the environment and AI system
    * Algorithms for finding failures and estimating probability of failure

* Day 5: Emergining Directions in AI Safety
    * Security risks (adversarial examples)
    * Holistic assessment
    * Emerging governance
