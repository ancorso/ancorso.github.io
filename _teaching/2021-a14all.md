Three week course on AI and robotics targeted toward 9th graders as part of <a href="https://ai-4-all.org/">AI4ALL</a>.


The course took place over 3 weeks and culminated in a final project where the students design a neural network based controller for autonomous aircraft taxiing. The first week focused on python programming, the second week focused on fundamental concepts in robotics such as planning and control, and the last week focused on machine learning and working on the project. See the gif below to see the result of their final project.
