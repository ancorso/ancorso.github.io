<h3>Longer</h3>
Anthony is a postdoctoral researcher in the Aeronautics and Astronautics Department at Stanford University where he is advised by Professor Mykel Kochenderfer in the Stanford Intelligent Systems Laboratory (SISL) and he is the executive director of the Stanford Center for AI Safety. His research is focused on the use of algorithmic decision-making for safety-critical applications, emphasizing the creation of robust, reliable autonomous systems. He has developed algorithms for the validation and verification of complex autonomous systems such as autonomous vehicles and aviation subsystems. More recently he has applied algorithmic decision making to low-carbon earth resource projects for storing carbon, producing renewable energy, and storing renewable fuels. He received his Ph.D. from Stanford in 2021. Before that he received a B.S. in physics from Harvey Mudd College in 2014 with an emphasis on computational methods. He is a recipient of the Stanford Graduate Fellowship and the Nicholas J. Hoff award for outstanding performance as a Masterâ€™s Student.
